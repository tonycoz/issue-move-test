# Imager 0.93

Released 15 Oct 2012

Bug fixes:
- previously a transparency enabled GIF write (the default) would always use a GIF89a header even if none of the images were transparent. 
- previously the probe step for freetype-config would fail on cygwin 
- catch an invalid matrix parameter to convert() instead of crashing https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/79922 
- remove the 16-bit/sample limitation from the documentation for setsamples(), it hasn't applied for many releases. https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/79989 
- don't copy setsamples() data parameter, it may be a large scalar https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/79990 
- clean up .dSYM directories generated performing probes on OS X Mountain Lion. 
- pass the --verbose command-line option through to Imager::Probe in sub-module's Makefile.PLs https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/75878 Enhancements: 
- support for giflib 5.0. (5.0.1 and later) https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/79029 The giflib API Imager uses doesn't have a mechanism to set the header version in 5.0.0. 
- update the GIF library probe code to check for the new giflib 5.0.1 EGifSetGifVersion() function, and to check for the giflib 4.2.0 uninitialized gif89 bug. https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/79679 http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3574283&group_id=102202&atid=631304 
- avoid static variables when capturing IPTC data from JPEG files 
- match Imager::Font::T1's error message translations to those from later versions of T1Lib. 
- for libtiff versions that support extended warning handlers (3.8.0 or later), use them to avoid some global variables. 
- note Image::ExifTool for better metadata support. https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/79251
