# Imager 1.006

[ / ](..) [releases/](./) 1.006

Released 26 Aug 2017

- the internal i_errors() function now correctly allocates the stack space needed for its result. https://rt.perl.org/rt3/Ticket/Display.html?id=131938

- t/100-base/020-color.t now uses Imager::Test's test functions instead of its own. [#433](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/433)

- write_multi() now returns an error result (a false value) if called with a non-(Imager image object). Previously it would typically crash. [#436](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/436)

- improve the documentation of the jpegquality parameter when writing JPEG files.

- add code to mitigate CVE-2016-1238, Imager will no longer search the default current directory entry in @INC when searching for file format support modules.
