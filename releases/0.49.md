# Imager HASH(0x5652d88fcf28)

- handle short EXIF user_comment fields correctly, previously Imager  would read (and potentially) write beyond the end of an allocated block,  or through a NULL pointer if the EXIF user_comment field was less  than 8 bytes long.  https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/17981
- tifflib 3.8.0 with MDI (Microsoft(tm) TIFF) support produces a   different error when it reads a file with a bad magic number.  Update the test to handle the possible messages.
- some jpeg.c logging calls didn't include parameters enough to match  the supplied format string. (detected by valgrind)
- in some cases memory wasn't being freed during error handling when  reading jpeg images (detected by valgrind)
- free the TIFF object correctly when reading a TIFF image and the   page number is out of range. (detected by valgrind)
- i_gsampf() (used to implement getsamples() for floating point samples)  was leaking memory. (detected by valgrind)
- writing to a PNG file was leaking one memory block  (detected by valgrind)
- some error paths when reading GIF images weren't closing the GIF  read object. (detected by valgrind)
- bump to 0.49 (to get #17981 fix out)
