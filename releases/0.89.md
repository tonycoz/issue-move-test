# Imager 0.89

Released 18 Mar 2012

Bug fixes:

- getpixel(..., type => "float") and the API i_gpixf() have been broken on paletted images since they were implemented. [#345](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/345)

Other changes:

- links in the METHOD INDEX now point at the method documentation rather than the heading you can find them under. [#318](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/318)

- Imager (and the bundled dynamic modules) no longer fallback to using DynaLoader if loading via XSLoader fails. For the bundled modules this could hide useful error messages. [#346](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/346)

- IM_DEBUG_MALLOC mymalloc() no longer sn?printfs() a string to a buffer in the array of allocations, but just stores the filename pointer and line number. [#312](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/312)
