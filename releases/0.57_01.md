# Imager 0.57_01

Released 11 May 2007

- added to_rgb16 to produce a 16-bit/sample version of an image 
- improve freetype 1.x text output efficiency Bug fixes: 
- search another place for rgb.txt, and check all the places Imager::Color checks when deciding whether to skip testing it [#119](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/119) 
- use a convolution kernel size based on the stddev rather than a fixed size when performing a gaussian blur [#117](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/117) 
- document the difference() method's mindist parameter, and debug it. 
- put the Imager release number in the Inline::C generated code to regenerate Inline code when a new release of Imager is installed. [#123](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/123) 
- fix rendering on alpha channel images for the FreeType 1.x driver. [#55](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/55) 
- fix rendering on alpha channel images for the T1lib driver. [#55](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/55) 
- reworked library probing, we can now set more than one probe function for a library. Disabled the default (non-freetype-config) library probe and added an extra probe function that searches for both ft2build.h and whatever it includes, and adds -I as needed. Hopefully this will fix build problems like http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/2007/05/msg472281.html [#120](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/120)
