# Imager 0.80

Released 17 Jan 2011

- added coverage tests for Imager::Fountain and Imager::Color::Float 
- Imager is now maintained in git http://git.imager.perl.org/imager.git git://git.imager.perl.org/imager.git Bug fixes: 
- images with an translucent alpha channel were not scaled correctly by the default (qtype=normal) scaling method. https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/63922 
- Imager::Color::Float now translates "#FFFFFF" to white instead of just a little darker. 
- make the default color map build algorithm "mediancut". This changes the default color map builder for writing GIFs back to what it was in 0.77, reverting a performance regression. https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/64785 
- handle failure to create a masked image correctly
