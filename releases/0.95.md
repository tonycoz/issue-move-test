# Imager 0.95

Released 19 Apr 2013

- handle the SVf_UTF8 flag correctly on magic strings passed to Imager::IO's write() and raw_write() methods. This may misbehave in perl 5.6.x since the UTF8 flag may not be visible in the main SV after SvGETMAGIC(). [#83438](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/83438) 
- document that bounding_box() ignores the transformation matrix supplied to tranform() for fonts. [#84106](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/84106)
