= Imager HASH(0x563986d06708)

Released 14 Mar 2011

Bug fixes:
- eliminate calls to i_has_format() from the test suite, since it's no longer a useful way to check for file format support. Eliminate i_has_format() from the functions exposed via XS. https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/65863 
- eliminate calls to note(), which isn't in the (very old) version of Test::More we have as a pre-requisite. note() is modern enough that I don't feel a need to require a Test::More upgrade for it. https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/65864 
- skip the threads tests on Test::More 2.00_* https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/65812 
- add an (unshipped) test to check Imager's internal POD links https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/65749 
- improve the library detection summary https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/9675 
- increase the version of Imager::Font::Type1 so that upgrades don't downgrade the version in this file. https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/66250 
- if we see an -rpath (or -R) option in $Config{lddlflags} supply that option for the directories that would normally go in LD_RUN_PATH. Typically an explicit -rpath overrides LD_RUN_PATH. https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/65955
