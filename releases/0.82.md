# Imager 0.82

[ / ](..) [releases/](./)

Released 14 Mar 2011

Bug fixes:

- eliminate calls to i_has_format() from the test suite, since it's no longer a useful way to check for file format support. Eliminate i_has_format() from the functions exposed via XS. [#261](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/261)

- eliminate calls to note(), which isn't in the (very old) version of Test::More we have as a pre-requisite. note() is modern enough that I don't feel a need to require a Test::More upgrade for it. [#262](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/262)

- skip the threads tests on Test::More 2.00_* [#259](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/259)

- add an (unshipped) test to check Imager's internal POD links [#258](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/258)

- improve the library detection summary [#44](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/44)

- increase the version of Imager::Font::Type1 so that upgrades don't downgrade the version in this file. [#264](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/264)

- if we see an -rpath (or -R) option in $Config{lddlflags} supply that option for the directories that would normally go in LD_RUN_PATH. Typically an explicit -rpath overrides LD_RUN_PATH. [#263](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/263)
