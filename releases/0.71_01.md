# Imager 0.71_01

Released 30 Nov 2009

Bug fixes:
- use scanline oriented operations to flip images instead of pixel operations [#196](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/196)
- use double/sample operations to flip large sample images instead of 8-bit sample operations. [#197](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/197)
- fix POD nits [#213](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/213)
- prevent double-frees when someone creates Imager objects and then creates a thread. Note: this just handles some simple cases, Imager doesn't support perl threads, and isn't likely to. [#214](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/214)
