# Imager 0.71_01

Released 30 Nov 2009

Bug fixes:
- use scanline oriented operations to flip images instead of pixel operations [#39278](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/39278) 
- use double/sample operations to flip large sample images instead of 8-bit sample operations. [#39280](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/39280) 
- fix POD nits [#51874](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/51874) 
- prevent double-frees when someone creates Imager objects and then creates a thread. Note: this just handles some simple cases, Imager doesn't support perl threads, and isn't likely to. [#52268](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/52268)
