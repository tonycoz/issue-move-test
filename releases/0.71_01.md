# Imager 0.71_01

Released 30 Nov 2009

Bug fixes:
- use scanline oriented operations to flip images instead of pixel operations https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/39278 
- use double/sample operations to flip large sample images instead of 8-bit sample operations. https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/39280 
- fix POD nits https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/51874 
- prevent double-frees when someone creates Imager objects and then creates a thread. Note: this just handles some simple cases, Imager doesn't support perl threads, and isn't likely to. https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/52268
