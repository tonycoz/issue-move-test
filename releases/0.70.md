# Imager HASH(0x5652d8929068)

Released 21 Sep 2009

Bug fixes:
- release image row and comments memory on all error returns in gif reader 
- handle zero length extensions, previously this would cause a null pointer dereference Thanks to Krzysztof Wojta≈õ for the test data and fix for this. 
- an integer division meant that preview scaling to below 1 pixel wide or high (which isn't too useful anyway) was calculating using NaNs on most platforms, and causing an exception on others. Thanks to David Cantrell for producing a backtrace of the crash on his Alpha-NetBSD CPAN test box which made it possible to track this down.
