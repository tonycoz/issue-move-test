# Imager 1.002

Released 03 Apr 2015

- drawing anti-aliased filled circles is now 10 to 50 times faster depending on the size of the circle. This also changed the center from being the center of the pixel to being the top left of the pixel to match the filled arcs drawn by arc(). [#423](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/423)
- enhancements to polygon filling:
- added a mode parameter to control how overlapping regions behave
- added a polypolygon() method to fill more than one polygon at a time
- polygon filling is now exposed through the API.
- added colormodel(), alphachannel() and colorchannels() methods. These were added for two reasons:
- a future version of Imager may allow the number of channels in an image to not directly represent the color model of an image. eg. a greyscale TIFF image with multiple alpha channels.
- a future version of Imager may allow an image to be read without translation, for example a TIFF file that contains measurements from an instrument. Currently Imager transforms the samples into the range 0.0 ... 1.0 which may means the user has to translate the value back.
An untranslated image would be unusable as image data, so
colormodel() would return "unknown" in this case.
Similarly a CMYK image might be returned as an "unknown" color
model image, if the caller chooses to disable translation to
RGB.
