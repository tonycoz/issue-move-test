# Imager 0.68

Released 07 Sep 2009

- Imager->new(file => $filename) and other similar incantations will load the given file. [#48261](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/48261) Bug fixes: 
- avoid using CHECK as a label in Imager::Test http://nntp.x.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/5220921 
- re-work most image file test files that require a library into separate library present/not present files to remove stupidly long conditionals 
- don't treat rubthrough() outside the bounds of the target image as an error. http://nntp.x.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/5185716
