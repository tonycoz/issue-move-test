# Imager 0.10

[ / ](..) [releases/](./) 0.10

Released 07 Jun 1999

- Added T1 postscript font handling. It's very primitive  at the moment but creative people can do nice stuff   with it.  Currently it is not possible to have it   generate an image of the correct size for a given string   but that is on the way.
