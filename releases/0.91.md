# Imager 0.91

[ / ](..) [releases/](./)

Released 04 Jun 2012

Bug fixes:

- The size of rotated images is no longer rounded up so aggressively. Added rounding to the linear interpolation done for rotate() and matrix_transform() for 1 and 3 channel 8-bit images. Adjusted the two tranlate matrices used to build the final rotation matrix to use the distance between the outlier pixels rather than the pixel dimensions (ie. dimension-1). With all of this the output of rotate(degrees => 270) on an 8-bit image exactly matches the output of rotate(right => 270). [#352](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/352)

Other changes:

- eliminate the old IIM_new(), IIM_DESTROY() names from Imager's internals, those names only matter for the XS interface.

- improve error reporting when PERL_INITIALIZE_IMAGER_CALLBACKS finds the API level compiled into a loadable module such as Imager::File::GIF doesn't match that of Imager. Previously it could be difficult to determine exactly which module was failing to load. [#353](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/353)

- added Imager->check_file_limits() as an interface to the i_int_check_image_file_limits() API.

- Imager->set_file_limits(reset => 1) now resets the limits to the defaults rather than setting them all to unlimited.

- wrote a brief security note as Imager::Security [#279](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/279)
