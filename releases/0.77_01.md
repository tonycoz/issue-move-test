# Imager 0.77_01

Released 13 Sep 2010

- add each library-directory/pkgconfig/ to the pkg-config search path in Imager::Probe. Thanks to Justin Davis. [#60491](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/60491) 
- moved GIF, TIFF, JPEG file handling code into sub-modules in preparation for separate distribution. [#49616](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/49616) (partial) Note: this removed support for libungif from Imager. 
- optimize filled box drawing (color, not fill) Bug fixes: 
- Imager::Probe was calling ExtUtils::Liblist to initialize LD_RUN_PATH supplying an undefined value rather than the found directory. Thanks to Justin Davis. [#60491](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/60491) 
- only prepend ./ to font filenames when passing them to T1Lib and then only when it would use its search mechanisms. [#60509](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/60509) 
- fix the cache check for the X rgb.txt loader. This is typically used for color translation on Unix-like systems, and the fix improves performance of supplying colors by name by about 80 times. Test code that managed 3400 10x10 pixel boxes/second sped up to 25700 boxes/second. 
- clarify that Imager doesn't write EXIF metadata to images. [#60637](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/60637) 
- Imager::Probe can now search subdirectories under its include path. Used by the PNG Makefile.PL to find headers and libraries when they aren't in the base directory, as in cygwin. [#60635](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/60635)
