# Imager 0.77_01

Released 13 Sep 2010

- add each library-directory/pkgconfig/ to the pkg-config search path in Imager::Probe. Thanks to Justin Davis. [#232](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/232)

- moved GIF, TIFF, JPEG file handling code into sub-modules in preparation for separate distribution. [#210](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/210) (partial)

Note: this removed support for libungif from Imager.

- optimize filled box drawing (color, not fill)

Bug fixes:

- Imager::Probe was calling ExtUtils::Liblist to initialize LD_RUN_PATH supplying an undefined value rather than the found directory. Thanks to Justin Davis. [#232](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/232)

- only prepend ./ to font filenames when passing them to T1Lib and then only when it would use its search mechanisms. [#233](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/233)

- fix the cache check for the X rgb.txt loader. This is typically used for color translation on Unix-like systems, and the fix improves performance of supplying colors by name by about 80 times. Test code that managed 3400 10x10 pixel boxes/second sped up to 25700 boxes/second.

- clarify that Imager doesn't write EXIF metadata to images. [#236](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/236)

- Imager::Probe can now search subdirectories under its include path. Used by the PNG Makefile.PL to find headers and libraries when they aren't in the base directory, as in cygwin. [#235](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/235)
