Released 12 Dec 2008

- 24-bit color .ICO/.CUR files can now be read. Bug fixes: 
- an optimization skipping 0 src alpha values could cause the rubthrough() to read past the end of a buffer. http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/2008/05/msg1509184.html 
- corrected a reference leak where writing GIFs would leak memory. This could also happen calling to_paletted(). Also documented the underlying long existing feature where the colors parameter is filled with the generated color table and added tests for it. https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/41028 
- write out the image size in bytes field of a BMP correctly. https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/41406 
- add limited tests for Imager::ExtUtils 
- make Imager::ExtUtils->includes use an absolute path, since a relative path could cause failures using Inline::C. https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/37353 
- re-arrange the POD for Imager::Font::BBox:
- mark total_width(), pos_width(), end_offset() obsolete, since they're mostly for backwards compatibility
- group width methods and height methods https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/39999
