# Imager 0.66

[ / ](..) [releases/](./) 0.66

Released 12 Dec 2008

 - 24-bit color .ICO/.CUR files can now be read.

Bug fixes:

 - an optimization skipping 0 src alpha values could cause the rubthrough() to read past the end of a buffer. [cpan.testers #1509184](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/2008/05/msg1509184.html)

 - corrected a reference leak where writing GIFs would leak memory. This could also happen calling to_paletted(). Also documented the underlying long existing feature where the colors parameter is filled with the generated color table and added tests for it. [#199](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/199)

 - write out the image size in bytes field of a BMP correctly. [#200](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/200)

 - add limited tests for Imager::ExtUtils

 - make Imager::ExtUtils->includes use an absolute path, since a relative path could cause failures using Inline::C. [#195](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/195)

 - re-arrange the POD for Imager::Font::BBox:

   - mark total_width(), pos_width(), end_offset() obsolete, since they're mostly for backwards compatibility

   - group width methods and height methods [#198](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/198)
