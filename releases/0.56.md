- added support for writing 16-bit/sample PGM/PPM images 
- improved performance of reading PBM/PGM/PPM images 
- added support for writing PBM images if the image is paletted and contains only black and white 
- added a new make_colors value - "mono" 
- switched from the svn log Changes to a manual Changes to reduce noise 
- new sample code - samples/flasher.pl Bug fixes: 
- CRITICAL: the "Imager" typemap entry (not used by Imager itself) was returning an image object with an extra reference, this resulted in a memory leak. [rt.cpan.org #24992](https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=24992) 
- fix rendering on alpha channel images for the FreeType 2.x driver [#55](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/55) 
- reading bmp files now consitently handles short reads. You can now supply a parameter to treat a short read as successful and set i_incomplete [#36](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/36) 
- previously, reading ASCII PBM files required spaces between samples, even though the format doesn't require that 
- improved documentation of the unsharpmask filter (I hope) [#114](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/114) 
- force flushing of the output from i_tt_dump_names() and test output in t/t35ttfont.t to prevent output from being mixed up. [#113](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/113) 
- rewrite a conditional expression as an if() to hopefully work around a bug in the pre-4.0 GCC Apple shipped with OS X 10.4. [#116](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/116) 
- avoid Data::Dumper in regops.perl to support older releases of perl [#111](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/111)
