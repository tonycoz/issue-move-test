# Imager 0.99

[ / ](..) [releases/](./) 0.99

Released 25 Jun 2014

- Imager::IO->new_buffer() (and hence Imager->read()'s data parameter) now accepts a reference to a scalar as well as just a plain scalar. [#405](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/405)

- Imager::IO->new_buffer() now always makes a copy of the passed in buffer to avoid problems with temporary objects used for the return value of SvPVbyte(). [#405](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/405)

- improved the XS for i_io_read() and i_io_raw_read() [#404](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/404)

- load plugins from absolute paths on Android Thanks to Brian Fraser. [#406](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/406)

- added the jpeg_optimize parameter for writing JPEG files. This can significantly reduce file sizes, but uses more memory and time. [#407](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/407)

- the autolevels filter now works on the luminosity of the image rather then working per channel. The old autolevels filter is still available as "autolevels_skew". [#408](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/408)

- Imager::File::PNG now supports libpng 1.6.10. 1.6.10 changed CRC errors from benign errors to normal errors, which broke the test which used CRC errors to check for benign error support. Switched to using a 1-bit grey-scale image with a palette to test for benign errors. [#409](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/409)
