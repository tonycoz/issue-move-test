# Imager 0.23

[ / ](..) [releases/](./) 0.23

- Fixed the %instances bug - caused ALL memory to be leaked.  Added real noise function - need feedback on how it should  be used. Also box(), and polyline are now in place.  Polygon  is missing but antialiased line drawing with integer endpoints are  done but should be replaced with a version that can have   floating point endvalues. Two noise filters addded.
