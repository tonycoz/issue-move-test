# Imager 0.79

Released 10 Dec 2010

- add Imager::Test to the POD coverage tests and document the missing functions.
- the convert() method now optimizes the case where all output channels are either 0, sourced from a single input channel or 1. This significantly speeds up presets like "addalpha", "green". [#211](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/211)
- add wiggle.pl sample, as suggested by Dan Oppenheim.
- add the combine() method to combine channels from multiple source images into a new image [#53](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/53)
Bug fixes:
- treat the co-efficients for convert() as doubles instead of floats.
- If a higher (earlier) priority font handler failed to load, that would crash preventing loading of later font handlers. [#241](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/241)
- parse defines from the options returned by pkg-config --cflags [#243](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/243)
- a regen of the MANIFEST revealed that GIF and FT2 tests weren't included in the tarball. They are now included.
