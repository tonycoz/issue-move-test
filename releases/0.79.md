# Imager 0.79

Released 10 Dec 2010

- add Imager::Test to the POD coverage tests and document the missing functions. 
- the convert() method now optimizes the case where all output channels are either 0, sourced from a single input channel or 1. This significantly speeds up presets like "addalpha", "green". [#51254](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/51254) 
- add wiggle.pl sample, as suggested by Dan Oppenheim. 
- add the combine() method to combine channels from multiple source images into a new image [#11872](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/11872) Bug fixes: 
- treat the co-efficients for convert() as doubles instead of floats. 
- If a higher (earlier) priority font handler failed to load, that would crash preventing loading of later font handlers. [#62855](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/62855) 
- parse defines from the options returned by pkg-config --cflags [#63223](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/63223) 
- a regen of the MANIFEST revealed that GIF and FT2 tests weren't included in the tarball. They are now included.
