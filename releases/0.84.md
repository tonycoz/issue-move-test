# Imager 0.84

[ / ](..) [releases/](./) 0.84

Released 20 Jun 2011

 - Imager no longer inherits from Exporter (unless you're running an old, old perl.

 - Imager can now write progressive JPEGs (it could always read them). [[#275]](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/275)

Bug fixes:

 - re-work, document and test Imager's logging facility. [[#250]](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/250)

 - fix META.yml testing and the generated META.yml [[#252]](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/252)

 - test and add error reporting to to_*() family methods

 - add to_rgb_double() method. [[#248]](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/248)

 - Imager no longer exports anything by default [[#251]](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/251)

 - convert colors to grayscale if the supplied (or generated) palette contains only grays when performing error diffusion color translation. [[#273]](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/273)

 - writing a paletted image to GIF wouldn't always use the colors supplied (or generated, eg. via make_colors => "mono"), which was confusing at best. [[#270]](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/270)

 - replace (imager|tony)@imager.perl.org in the doc, since I don't plan to continue receiving mail at that address. [[#274]](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/274)
