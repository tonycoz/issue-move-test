# Imager 0.84

Released 20 Jun 2011

- Imager no longer inherits from Exporter (unless you're running an old, old perl. 
- Imager can now write progressive JPEGs (it could always read them). [#68691](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/68691) Bug fixes: 
- re-work, document and test Imager's logging facility. [#65227](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/65227) 
- fix META.yml testing and the generated META.yml [#65235](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/65235) 
- test and add error reporting to to_*() family methods 
- add to_rgb_double() method. [#65101](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/65101) 
- Imager no longer exports anything by default [#65228](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/65228) 
- convert colors to grayscale if the supplied (or generated) palette contains only grays when performing error diffusion color translation. [#68508](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/68508) 
- writing a paletted image to GIF wouldn't always use the colors supplied (or generated, eg. via make_colors => "mono"), which was confusing at best. [#67912](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/67912) 
- replace (imager|tony)@imager.perl.org in the doc, since I don't plan to continue receiving mail at that address. [#68591](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/68591)
