# Imager 0.55

Released 16 Dec 2006

This is primarily a bug fix release.
Note: Test::More is now a pre-requisite for Imager and is no longer bundled.
There is one new feature:
- the Win32 font driver now supports UTF8 (RT 22166) http://www.cpanforum.com/threads/3276 [#22166](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/22166) Several bugs were fixed: 
- the string() method would not output the string "0" [#21770](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/21770) 
- fills.c was failing to compile on Solaris 10 (compiler unknown) [#21944](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/21944) 
- the gif_disposal and gif_user_input tags weren't being read from the file correctly [#22192](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/22192) 
- gif.c was failing to build under MSVC [#23922](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/23922) 
- in some cases strings passed to the string() method were treated as terminated by NUL (chr 0) [#21770](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/21770) 
- on "MSWin32" perl builds we now link to -lzlib instead of -lz since that's the default build name for zlib on Win32. [#23064](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/23064) 
- search $Config{incpath} for headers too, which we should have been doing all along. Win32 font driver fixes: 
- the global descent value from bounding box was the wrong sign http://www.cpanforum.com/threads/3276 
- if the first or last glyph overflowed the left or right side of the advance width they would be clipped
