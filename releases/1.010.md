# Imager 1.010

Released 13 Feb 2019

General changes:
- added the add_file_magic() class method for adding magic for new file types to Imager's fairly primitive file magic detection. 
- fixed an embarassing documentation typo in Imager::Test. 
- trying to read from a GIF file with no images now sets an error message. Thanks to Peter Sergeant for reporting this. [#128481](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/128481) 
- use undeprecated encoding symbols for FT2. This should fix the build on the badly patched CentOS 7 Freetype 2. Thanks to Slaven Rezic for the report. [#128142](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/128142) Coverity has come back up read-only, a few more changes: 
- add missing va_end() for bmp.c's write_packed(). CID 185320. 
- similarly for read_packed(). CID 185329. 
- add a NOTREACHED lint comment for pixel_coverage(). Compilers complained about a missing return, Coverity complains about the return. CID 185325. 
- avoid a possible sign extension in imsgi.c. CID 185326. 
- add some FALLTHROUGH lint comments to i_readtga_wiol() where we deliberately fall through switch cases. CID 185328. 
- add assertions in callers to i_new_hatch_low() since Coverity complained about some possible inconsistent NULL checks. CID 185339. I ended up rearranging this function later. 
- remove pointless NULL checks from i_flipxy() and i_img_destroy().
