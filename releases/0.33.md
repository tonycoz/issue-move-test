# Imager HASH(0x5652d88bf730)

- Fixed the end message from Imager 0.32.  Destroy called  on an empty image.  Did some work on the polygon method.    Some clean up in the Makefile.PL script.  Fixed a buffer  overrun in the t_transform in Imager.XS.  Fixed the   error handling in the jpeg loader.  It now correctly  returns undef if a load on an image fails.  It also   sends the error messages to the log file.  Added errstr()  method to the image object.  Added a new way to read()  objects from scalars.  So far this is only implemented for  jpeg, png and gif.  ppm and raw soon - as always if someone  wants to do an overhaul on the ppm stuff feel free.  It seems  like such a basic format that interfacing with a library is more  work than implementing all of the needed routines instead.
