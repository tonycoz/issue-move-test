# Imager 0.62

[ / ](..) [releases/](./) 0.62

Released 10 Dec 2007

 - Makefile.PL now expands ~/path supplied to --incpath or --libpath to /path under your home directory. [#151](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/151)

 - the old dynaload code used Mach API functions to load dynamic libraries on Mac OS X. These APIs have been deprecated in OS X 10.5 and were causing some build problems. So henceforth Imager uses the dlopen() family of functions, and you will need version 10.3 or later of OS X.

 - added the det() function to the transform2() engine. added the sample quad_to_square.pl Courtesy Richard Fairhurst. [#178](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/178)

Bug fixes:

 - samples/gifscale.pl sourced the base value for gif_top from gif_left. Thanks to Eleneldil G. Arilou for pointing this out.

 - t/t82inline.t no longer loads B at runtime, to work around a bug in some 5.005_0[45] installations. [#173](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/173)
