# Imager 0.61

[ / ](..) [releases/](./) 0.61

Released 05 Nov 2007

 - added samples/gifscale.pl, which adjusts the screen size/position tags when scaling an animated gif [#131](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/131)

Bug fixes:

 - correct handling of sz in matrix_transform() - this should allow perspective type transformations to work now. [#158](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/158)

 - prevent a cast to integer warning on x64 builds in datatypes.c also fixed some other type warnings [#169](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/169)

 - some sub-directory tests depended on files produced by the parent directory tests [#168](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/168)

 - Imager::Font::Wrap doesn't correctly set savepos thanks to Nikita Dedik and Eleneldil G. Arilou for reporting this. [#154](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/154)

 - test 171 in t/t01introvert.t was failing on perls configured to use long double. [#149](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/149)

 - the code for the transform2() uminus operator was missing a break. Added tests for better code coverage of the ops. [#146](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/146)

 - the SGI RLE compression code could overflow its compression buffer [#170](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/170)

 - the 32-bit output function used by the SGI code only handled values under 0x10000. This was most noticable when writing large RLE images. [#171](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/171)

 - validate chan_count for chans == NULL for each of the i_gsamp() implementations. [#140](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/140)

 - attempt to work around the test failure at [cpan.testers #650810](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/2007/09/msg650810.html) [#152](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/152)

 - improve the error messages produced when attempting to read or write an unknown image file format. [#165](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/165)

 - improve the transform2() documentation [#144](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/144)

 - correctly generate the author key in META.yml [#172](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/172)

 - correctly blend a rotated (or matrix_transformed()) image when performing interpolation in the presence of an alpha channel. Also corrected the centring of the rotated image on the output image.
