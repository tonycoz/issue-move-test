# Imager 0.61

Released 05 Nov 2007

- added samples/gifscale.pl, which adjusts the screen size/position tags when scaling an animated gif [#27591](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/27591) Bug fixes: 
- correct handling of sz in matrix_transform() - this should allow perspective type transformations to work now. [#29936](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/29936) 
- prevent a cast to integer warning on x64 builds in datatypes.c also fixed some other type warnings [#30204](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/30204) 
- some sub-directory tests depended on files produced by the parent directory tests [#30203](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/30203) 
- Imager::Font::Wrap doesn't correctly set savepos thanks to Nikita Dedik and Eleneldil G. Arilou for reporting this. [#29771](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/29771) 
- test 171 in t/t01introvert.t was failing on perls configured to use long double. [#29413](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/29413) 
- the code for the transform2() uminus operator was missing a break. Added tests for better code coverage of the ops. [#29296](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/29296) 
- the SGI RLE compression code could overflow its compression buffer [#30334](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/30334) 
- the 32-bit output function used by the SGI code only handled values under 0x10000. This was most noticable when writing large RLE images. [#30335](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/30335) 
- validate chan_count for chans == NULL for each of the i_gsamp() implementations. [#28985](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/28985) 
- attempt to work around the test failure at http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/2007/09/msg650810.html [#29562](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/29562) 
- improve the error messages produced when attempting to read or write an unknown image file format. [#30103](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/30103) 
- improve the transform2() documentation [#29267](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/29267) 
- correctly generate the author key in META.yml [#30377](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/30377) 
- correctly blend a rotated (or matrix_transformed()) image when performing interpolation in the presence of an alpha channel. Also corrected the centring of the rotated image on the output image.
