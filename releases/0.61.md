= Imager HASH(0x563986d1aba0)

Released 05 Nov 2007

- added samples/gifscale.pl, which adjusts the screen size/position tags when scaling an animated gif https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/27591 Bug fixes: 
- correct handling of sz in matrix_transform() - this should allow perspective type transformations to work now. https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/29936 
- prevent a cast to integer warning on x64 builds in datatypes.c also fixed some other type warnings https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/30204 
- some sub-directory tests depended on files produced by the parent directory tests https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/30203 
- Imager::Font::Wrap doesn't correctly set savepos thanks to Nikita Dedik and Eleneldil G. Arilou for reporting this. https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/29771 
- test 171 in t/t01introvert.t was failing on perls configured to use long double. https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/29413 
- the code for the transform2() uminus operator was missing a break. Added tests for better code coverage of the ops. https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/29296 
- the SGI RLE compression code could overflow its compression buffer https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/30334 
- the 32-bit output function used by the SGI code only handled values under 0x10000. This was most noticable when writing large RLE images. https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/30335 
- validate chan_count for chans == NULL for each of the i_gsamp() implementations. https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/28985 
- attempt to work around the test failure at http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/2007/09/msg650810.html https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/29562 
- improve the error messages produced when attempting to read or write an unknown image file format. https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/30103 
- improve the transform2() documentation https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/29267 
- correctly generate the author key in META.yml https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/30377 
- correctly blend a rotated (or matrix_transformed()) image when performing interpolation in the presence of an alpha channel. Also corrected the centring of the rotated image on the output image.
