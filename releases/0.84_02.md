# Imager 0.84_02

[ / ](..) [releases/](./) 0.84_02

Released 22 Aug 2011

Development release, this will become 0.85 if CPAN testers is favourable.

Bug fixes:

 - the image file limits set by set_file_limits() weren't being checked when reading TIFF files. [[#306]](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/306)

 - Provide more information about file format module load errors on a failed image file read() or write(). [[#287]](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/287)

 - use TIFFReadDirectory() instead of TIFFSetDirectory() to iterate through TIFF images, since it checks for IFD loops. [[#305]](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/305)

 - don't leak memory when out of range palette indexes are supplied to setscanline(). [[#288]](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/288)

 - require a later version of CPAN::Meta to ensure JSON::PP and CPAN::Meta::YAML are available. [[#282]](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/282)

 - hoist the per-line calculations for the flines implementations, and modernize the tests a bit. [[#311]](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/311)

 - detect snprintf()/vsnprintf() (cheat by using Config.pm) and use them when available. [[#283]](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/283)

 - if t1lib failed to reinitialize it would be left as marked initialized. [[#299]](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/299)

 - update the bundled (and still modified) Devel::CheckLib [[#286]](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/286)
