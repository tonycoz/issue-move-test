# Imager 0.84_02

Released 22 Aug 2011

Development release, this will become 0.85 if CPAN testers is favourable.
Bug fixes:
- the image file limits set by set_file_limits() weren't being checked when reading TIFF files. [#69915](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/69915) 
- Provide more information about file format module load errors on a failed image file read() or write(). [#69194](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/69194) 
- use TIFFReadDirectory() instead of TIFFSetDirectory() to iterate through TIFF images, since it checks for IFD loops. [#69914](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/69914) 
- don't leak memory when out of range palette indexes are supplied to setscanline(). [#69242](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/69242) 
- require a later version of CPAN::Meta to ensure JSON::PP and CPAN::Meta::YAML are available. [#69008](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/69008) 
- hoist the per-line calculations for the flines implementations, and modernize the tests a bit. [#70126](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/70126) 
- detect snprintf()/vsnprintf() (cheat by using Config.pm) and use them when available. [#69147](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/69147) 
- if t1lib failed to reinitialize it would be left as marked initialized. [#69877](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/69877) 
- update the bundled (and still modified) Devel::CheckLib [#69170](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/69170)
