# Imager HASH(0x5652d891a538)

Released 22 Aug 2011

Development release, this will become 0.85 if CPAN testers is favourable.
Bug fixes:
- the image file limits set by set_file_limits() weren't being checked when reading TIFF files. https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/69915 
- Provide more information about file format module load errors on a failed image file read() or write(). https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/69194 
- use TIFFReadDirectory() instead of TIFFSetDirectory() to iterate through TIFF images, since it checks for IFD loops. https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/69914 
- don't leak memory when out of range palette indexes are supplied to setscanline(). https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/69242 
- require a later version of CPAN::Meta to ensure JSON::PP and CPAN::Meta::YAML are available. https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/69008 
- hoist the per-line calculations for the flines implementations, and modernize the tests a bit. https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/70126 
- detect snprintf()/vsnprintf() (cheat by using Config.pm) and use them when available. https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/69147 
- if t1lib failed to reinitialize it would be left as marked initialized. https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/69877 
- update the bundled (and still modified) Devel::CheckLib https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/69170
