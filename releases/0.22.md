- Added a new method to write gif images - now   it is possible to have a part of a palette fixed.  this is very usefull if one needs to make sure that  some color like white is in the pallete.  This method  also allows some ditherding and gives better colormap  than the mediancut from the gif libraries.  It does  need much more cpu power though.  Hopefully later versions  will be faster.
