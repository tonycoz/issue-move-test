# Imager 0.60

[ / ](..) [releases/](./) 0.60

Released 30 Aug 2007

 - Finished/rewrote Arnar's old SGI RGB file format support, so Imager now has full SGI RGB image format, including RLE and 16-bit/sample images. [#39](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/39)

 - logging functions are now available in the API

 - applied Gabriel Vasseur's patch added documentation, further tests, and support for greyscale images Obviously problems are my fault :) [#135](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/135)

 - the mask for ICO/CUR images is now applied as an alpha channel to the returned image. For the old behaviour, supply ico_masked => 0 to read() or read_multi(). This should be less confusing when using Imager as a general image processor. [#141](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/141)

Bug fixes:

 - in some cases it's possible for giflib/libungif to return color indexes outside the range of colors defined by the image's palette. We now expand the palette to match the indexes used. Thanks to Gabriel Vasseur for reporting this.

 - fixed various memory leaks that could occur when failing to read png, jpeg, bmp or tga files.

 - to avoid confusion, channels not present in the image are returned as zero by getscanline(). This has no effect on the C level i_glin() and i_glinf() API functions which continue to not set the unused channels.

 - the convert() method now returns an image of the same sample size as the source image. [#136](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/136)

 - remove repeated text in Imager::Files [#130](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/130)

 - be even more explicit that scale() and friends don't modify the source image, but return a new image. [#137](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/137)

 - improve the error message from errstr() when you try to load a font for which the driver hasn't been built in Imager. [#129](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/129)

 - transparency is now enabled by default when writing GIF images [#132](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/132)

 - Imager would not load on Windows 98 [#133](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/133)
