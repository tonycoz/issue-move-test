# Imager 0.99_01

Released 29 Jun 2014

- GIF: add support for giflib 5.1.0, which added error code pointer parameters to EGifCloseFile() and DGifCloseFile(). [#412](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/412)

- GIF: avoid a double-free when do_write() fails.

- fix SV type probing to work on perl before 5.12. Broken in 0.99. [#413](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/413)

- PNG: skip the benign error test before libpng 1.6.0, since the error we're testing didn't exist before 1.6.0. [#409](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/409) (continued)
