# Imager HASH(0x5652d89039b8)

Released 29 Jun 2014

- GIF: add support for giflib 5.1.0, which added error code pointer parameters to EGifCloseFile() and DGifCloseFile(). https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/96756 
- GIF: avoid a double-free when do_write() fails. 
- fix SV type probing to work on perl before 5.12. Broken in 0.99. https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/96761 
- PNG: skip the benign error test before libpng 1.6.0, since the error we're testing didn't exist before 1.6.0. https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/94717 (continued)
