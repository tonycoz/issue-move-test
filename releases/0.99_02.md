# Imager HASH(0x5652d89039d0)

Released 21 Jul 2014

- Imager::Filter::Mandelbrot (and dynfilt/mandelbrot.c) - initialize the blue channel in the generated palette, and allow each color component to be in the range 100..255 instead of just 100..254. Thanks to Ralf Neubauer. https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/97086 
- revert "improved the XS for i_io_read() and i_io_raw_read()" This caused problems with older perls and didn't provide much of a performance improvement. 
- support Inline 0.57 and later. Inline 0.57 changed the "with" interface. https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/97108 
- don't define our own MAXINT macro, it conflicts with windows header files and in a few places it was the wrong value to use anyway. https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/96425
