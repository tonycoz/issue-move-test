# Imager HASH(0x5652d891a760)

Released 17 May 2011

Dev release, in case the compose tests are too sensitive.
Bug fixes:
- Imager::Font::T1 incorrectly checked for absolute filename under Win32. Thanks to kmx for the report and fix. https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/67963 
- compose() with the target, source or mask position off the top or left of the target image didn't clip the source image correctly. https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/67220 
- compose() now returns a useful error message on a non-positive opacity. 
- compose.im now at 100% test coverage. (As opposed to, umm, much, much less.)
