= Imager HASH(0x563986caa5c8)

- Bunch of documentation fixes, backed out ppm code.  Put in TonyC's giant transform2 patch.  Fixed the patch  to make it ansi compliant.  Fixed a bunch of bugs in the  Freetype code with regard to vertical and horizontal   positioning and bounding boxes.  Cleaned up a lot of the  code so it runs under -Wall.  Code that is still in   development such as the polygon converter do not compile  cleanly.  Fixed the non antialiased versions of truetype  dump to image routines.  Also removed the FIXME for the   hardcoding of antialias in the Imager string method.  Fixed sign error and a missing cache of the bounding box  calculation for the rasterize function.  Removed some  debugging code I forgot to remove.  Added iolayer.h  and iolayer.c but they don't do anything for now.
