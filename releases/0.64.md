# Imager HASH(0x5652d8929110)

Released 23 Apr 2008

This is a bug fix release. This includes a fix for a possible security issue.
Bug fixes:
- Possible security issue: The floating point sample path for image based fills had a buffer overflow. This would overwrite the end of a malloc()ed buffer with double precision floats. https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/35324 CVE-2008-1928 
- check that the result of fileno($fh) is defined rather than simply true when read() or write() is supplied with an fh parameter. https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/35139 
- i_scale_axis() wasn't checking the result of i_img_new_ch() resulting in a SIGSEGV when attempting to scale an image to a size too large to fit in memory. This is a NULL pointer access issue, not a buffer overflow. Added a check for the failure. scale_calculate() (and hence scale()) will now fail if any of the scale size parameters are a reference. https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/35172 
- Regression: filling a greyscale image with a hatch used the wrong color channels from the supplied fg/bg colors. https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/35278 
- fixed a related problem for image fills.
