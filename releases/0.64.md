# Imager 0.64

[ / ](..) [releases/](./)

Released 23 Apr 2008

This is a bug fix release. This includes a fix for a possible security issue.

Bug fixes:

- Possible security issue: The floating point sample path for image based fills had a buffer overflow. This would overwrite the end of a malloc()ed buffer with double precision floats. [#192](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/192) CVE-2008-1928

- check that the result of fileno($fh) is defined rather than simply true when read() or write() is supplied with an fh parameter. [#189](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/189)

- i_scale_axis() wasn't checking the result of i_img_new_ch() resulting in a SIGSEGV when attempting to scale an image to a size too large to fit in memory. This is a NULL pointer access issue, not a buffer overflow. Added a check for the failure. scale_calculate() (and hence scale()) will now fail if any of the scale size parameters are a reference. [#190](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/190)

- Regression: filling a greyscale image with a hatch used the wrong color channels from the supplied fg/bg colors. [#191](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/191)

- fixed a related problem for image fills.
