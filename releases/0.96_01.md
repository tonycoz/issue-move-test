= Imager HASH(0x563986cef660)

Released 01 Jul 2013

- TIFF: handle SampleFormat = 2 by translating the signed integer values to unsigned by flipping their sign bits. Handle SampleFormat = 3 where possible. SampleFormat is ignored for paletted images. Mixed SampleFormat are handled incorrectly, since libtiff returns only the first SampleFormat value, and an image with both an alpha channel and SampleFormat = 2 for color channels probably has a different SampleFormat for the alpha channel. https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/74540 
- XS clean up: https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/69243 
- Imager::Color's rgba() method now returns its values as integers instead of floating point. (IV instead of NV). 
- The XS for i_map() and i_matrix_transform() now use the AV * typemap instead of rolling their own. 
- The XS for DSO_call() now uses the HV * typemap instead of rolling it's own. 
- The XS for i_poly_aa(), i_poly_aa_cfill(), i_transform() and i_gradgen() now use a new T_AVARRAY typemap that greatly simplifies the XS code. 
- many other minor XS changes 
- some XS code formatting 
- TT (Freetype 1.x) and FT2 (Freetype 2.x) non-antialiased rendering now renders in alpha-combining mode, to match antialiased output. https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/73359 
- add sample code and cookbook notes for drawing a blurred drop-shadow. 
- add support for libpng 1.6, which changed the defaults for reporting some types of error. https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/85746 
- FT2: use gsamp/psamp() to transfer pixels from the work image to the output image instead of gpix/ppix. https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/83478 
- eliminate various GCC warnings, mostly initialized but otherwise unused variables.
