# Imager 0.88

Released 22 Feb 2012

- describe how to build libgif etc on OS X in such a way as to be compatible with a fat binary perl (such as the system perl), in README. [#333](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/333) 
- update the change notes for 0.77_01 to indicate that libungif support was removed. 
- add some other imaging modules to SEE ALSO [#335](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/335) 
- note that the generator of the apparently non-DFSG-free postscript in MMOne.pfb is a Debian package. 
- setsamples() is now a true complement to getsamples() - it can write 8-bit or floating point samples from a scalar or array reference. This adds i_psamp() and i_psampf() to the C level API. 
- the XS interfaces to i_gsamp(), i_gsampf() and i_gsamp_bits() have changed to make better use of the typemap, but these aren't part of the perl level API anyway. There were no changes to the C level interfaces to these functions. 
- getpixel() and setpixel() now accept a mix of scalar and array references for the x and y parameters, and unequal array lengths is no longer an error. [#334](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/334) Bug fixes: 
- correctly calculate the size of a rotated image [#293](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/293) 
- fix incorrect rounding of color values for matrix_transform() and rotate(). [#293](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/293) 
- Win32 text output is now done in normal combine mode, the alpha component of the color is now significant. [#308](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/308) 
- remove long unused gif case from read() [#290](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/290) (partial) 
- the getsamples() target parameter was being treated as a hashref when it's meant to be an array reference. [#341](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/341) 
- getpixel() and setpixel() now returns an empty list when invalid parameters are supplied. Invalid values for type now result in an error for getpixel(). [#334](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/334)
