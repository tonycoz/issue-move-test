# Imager 0.43_02

Released 26 Oct 2004

- the changes to scale() had some problems with integer vs floating point  calculations (only caught in tests under perl 5.8.5 <sigh>)
- the FT2 glyph_names() method didn't do correct error handling  when the string parameter wasn't supplied
- i_ft2_glyph_name() accepted only an unsigned char as the  character code to get the name for, which meant it  didn't work for unicode characters \x{100} or above
- the XS for i_ft2_glyph_name() had a similar problem
- added NameTest.ttf to be used in checking unicode glyph  names
- added reliable_only optional parameter to the glyph_names()  method so you can ignore theresult of FT_Has_PS_Glyph_Names()
- handle errors given by i_ft2_glyph_name() a bit more  correctly
- the FT1 glyph_names() method didn't do correct error handling   when the string parameter wasn't supplied
- some memory allocated when creating a callback IO object (io_new_cb)  wasn't being released (detected with valgrind)
- the testtools.pl match[nx]() functions escapes the test string on   test failure a bit better
- the XS code for i_tt_glyph_name() used unsigned char to store a   unicode character when it should have used unsigned long.
- the XS code for i_t1_glyph_name() used unsigned char to store a   unicode character when it should have used unsigned long.
- resolves [#7949](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/7949)
- the type 1 glyph_names() method didn't do correct error handling   when the string parameter wasn't supplied
- renamed io.h to imio.h to prevent problems building under cygwin.  resolve [#7948](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/7948)
- i_writegif_low() wasn't setting the returned global palette, which  meant a rubbish palette was returned to the user (detected with valgrind)
- built 0.43_02 for testing
