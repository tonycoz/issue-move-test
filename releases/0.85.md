# Imager 0.85

[ / ](..) [releases/](./) 0.85

Released 29 Aug 2011

The main changes in the release versus 0.84 are:

 - on 64-bit systems, 64-bit types are consistently used for image dimensions and co-ordinated, and for memory block sizes.

 - handle IFD loops in TIFF files correctly. Previously this would lead to an infinite loop.

Bug fixes:

 - fix the link in the getheight() entry in the method index
