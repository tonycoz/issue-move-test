# Imager 0.85_02

Released 24 Oct 2011

Bug fixes:
- eliminate unused i_gif_opts type (clean-up) [#291](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/291)
- fix combine=0 fill color anti-aliasing on the double/sample path [#315](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/315)
- make default text color non-transparent [#316](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/316)
- apply the last of the Debian unforwarded spelling fixes [#314](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/314)
- the log() method used its message parameter as a C level format string. [#324](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/324)
- provide our own STRLEN typemap entry for older perls. [#321](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/321)
- add extra ppport.h configuration to support older perls.
- depend on Scalar::Util, since we use it and older perls don't have it.
- add overloaded eq to Imager::Matrix2d, since older perls don't seem to synthesize it from overloaded "".
- use T1_StrError() for error messages on modern libt1 [#300](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/300)
- actually load the font rather than just adding it to the catalog on creation.
- Imager::Font->new now produces better error messages for the T1 engine.
- the font has_chars() method now returns perl's true and false values in list context rather than integers, which should be more efficient. [#285](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/285)
- the btm data structure used by the flood_fill code is now initialized more efficiently. [#281](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/281)
- updated the Thanks list in README [#320](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/320)
- check there's at least one coefficient for the convolution filter [#280](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/280)
- make the APIRef synopsis ordering consistent, older versions of perl could order it differently. [#325](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/325)
- we rely on Config.pm's d_vsnprintf as to whether we use vsnprintf/snprintf, which is defined in the Win32 Config.pm even though it only has _ prefixed versions of these. Define our own prefixed names on Win32. [#322](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/322)
- fix library detection with MSVC
- search a few more library directories, so EU::MM doesn't discard them. Hopefully fixes: [#323](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/323)
