# Imager 0.85_02

Released 24 Oct 2011

Bug fixes:
- eliminate unused i_gif_opts type (clean-up) [#69245](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/69245) 
- fix combine=0 fill color anti-aliasing on the double/sample path [#71309](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/71309) 
- make default text color non-transparent [#71469](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/71469) 
- apply the last of the Debian unforwarded spelling fixes [#70656](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/70656) 
- the log() method used its message parameter as a C level format string. [#71653](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/71653) 
- provide our own STRLEN typemap entry for older perls. [#71641](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/71641) 
- add extra ppport.h configuration to support older perls. 
- depend on Scalar::Util, since we use it and older perls don't have it. 
- add overloaded eq to Imager::Matrix2d, since older perls don't seem to synthesize it from overloaded "". 
- use T1_StrError() for error messages on modern libt1 [#69879](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/69879) 
- actually load the font rather than just adding it to the catalog on creation. 
- Imager::Font->new now produces better error messages for the T1 engine. 
- the font has_chars() method now returns perl's true and false values in list context rather than integers, which should be more efficient. [#69158](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/69158) 
- the btm data structure used by the flood_fill code is now initialized more efficiently. [#68994](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/68994) 
- updated the Thanks list in README [#71607](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/71607) 
- check there's at least one coefficient for the convolution filter [#68993](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/68993) 
- make the APIRef synopsis ordering consistent, older versions of perl could order it differently. [#71675](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/71675) 
- we rely on Config.pm's d_vsnprintf as to whether we use vsnprintf/snprintf, which is defined in the Win32 Config.pm even though it only has _ prefixed versions of these. Define our own prefixed names on Win32. [#71642](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/71642) 
- fix library detection with MSVC 
- search a few more library directories, so EU::MM doesn't discard them. Hopefully fixes: [#71643](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/71643)
