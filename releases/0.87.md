Released 03 Jan 2012

- document the return value of the filter() method. https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/72369 
- document i_gsamp_bits() and i_psamp_bits(). https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/68815 
- properly increment the Imager::Matrix2d $VERSION. 
- actually include the Imager::Test tests in the dist 
- correctly read and write 256x256 pixel ICO files https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/69599 
- make the error message from read() or read_multi() when they can't identify the file type match reality. https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/72475 
- read() now uses $FORMATGUESS if it can't determine the file type based on the file header, to match read_multi(). 
- re-work and add tests for def_guess_type(). def_guess_type() no longer returns any random file extension as the file type. 
- add gray4, gray16 and gray as presets for make_colors. https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/67911 
- add make_palette() method that produces a palette from one or more images. 
- fix the Imager dependency for the separately distributed font drivers. https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/72643 
- fix i_render_color() to properly draw in "normal" mode - ie. when writing to a 1 or 3 channel image the second or fourth channel of the source color was being ignored, it is now significant. https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/71564
