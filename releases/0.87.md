# Imager 0.87

[ / ](..) [releases/](./)

Released 03 Jan 2012

- document the return value of the filter() method. [#330](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/330)

- document i_gsamp_bits() and i_psamp_bits(). [#277](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/277)

- properly increment the Imager::Matrix2d $VERSION.

- actually include the Imager::Test tests in the dist

- correctly read and write 256x256 pixel ICO files [#295](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/295)

- make the error message from read() or read_multi() when they can't identify the file type match reality. [#331](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/331)

- read() now uses $FORMATGUESS if it can't determine the file type based on the file header, to match read_multi().

- re-work and add tests for def_guess_type(). def_guess_type() no longer returns any random file extension as the file type.

- add gray4, gray16 and gray as presets for make_colors. [#269](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/269)

- add make_palette() method that produces a palette from one or more images.

- fix the Imager dependency for the separately distributed font drivers. [#464](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/464)

- fix i_render_color() to properly draw in "normal" mode - ie. when writing to a 1 or 3 channel image the second or fourth channel of the source color was being ignored, it is now significant. [#319](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/319)
