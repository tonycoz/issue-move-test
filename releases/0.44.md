# Imager 0.44

[ / ](..) [releases/](./)

Released 15 Dec 2004

- modify the default include directories list to include the location  FreeBSD keeps freetype1 headers after the freetype2 locations.  This ensures that the -I options are generated with freetype2  locations first, so that those directories are searched before  the freetype1 directories.  This prevents problems compiling  font.c on FreeBSD.  Resolves: [#13](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/13)

- finish off a sentence in the "Producing an image from a CGI script"  example in Imager::Files

- method index didn't include errstr()

- document that you don't want the FT2 freetype.h in the include path
