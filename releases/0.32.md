# Imager HASH(0x5652d88bf388)

- Added the getcolorcount method.  Fixed interlace handling  on png images.  Fixed the missing channel count in crop()  method. Rewrote most of t1lib database stuff - created color  and font classes.  T1 stuff is mostly done - TT things were  rewritten too and now include most of what is needed for  pixmap caching.  Added documentation for fonts.  Comments have  been added to some of the relevant c-routines.  Added a copy()  function in Imager.xs and a corresponding method name.  Changed the underlying data type for the raw XS images from  pointers to objects - this will hopefully catch the most  basic errors and keep the segfaulting down.  This means that  all of the underlying XS calls for readjpeg, readgif, readpng   and readraw do not take the first parameter any more.    Made fixes to keep it not spewing warning on 5.004 perl.          **** If you had any code that didn't use the OO interface ****  ****         It will probably not work any longer         ****
