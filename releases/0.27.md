# Imager 0.27

[ / ](..) [releases/](./) 0.27

- This is a bugfix version mostly, thanks to claes for pointing  out the problems - fixed palette saving wasn't working correctly after  version 0.24 - rather surprised this didn't crash everything.  Also fixed that for t1 fonts the bounding box wasn't being reported   unless the font had been used before.  This is either a bug in t1lib  or a mistake in it's documentation.  Another lingering bug since 0.24  what that $img->box() wasn't creating it's default color properly.  Added i_tt_text() method and more debuging to the truetype routines.              truetype testcase fixed and old debug rubish removed.
