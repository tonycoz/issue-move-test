# Imager 0.71

[ / ](..) [releases/](./) 0.71

Released 16 Nov 2009

 - add the opacity fill type - an adaptor that modifies the opacity of another fill.

Bug fixes:

 - the conv filter now enforces that the sum of the coefficients is non-zero. Also, rather than skipping pixels off the edge off the edge of the image, the closest edge pixel is used. Previously dividing by the zero sum of coefficients could cause invalid results or runtime exceptions. Thanks to David Cantrell's Alpha-NetBSD CPAN test box for revealing this bug.
