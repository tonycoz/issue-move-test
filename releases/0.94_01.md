# Imager 0.94_01

[ / ](..) [releases/](./) 0.94_01

Released 02 Mar 2013

- NOTE: possibly backward incompatible: support reading from/writing to perl filehandes that aren't raw files.

This allows Imager's I/O to honour handles with layers such as

gzip, scalar file handles or tied file handles.

This is backward incompatible in that previous Imager would simply

use fileno() to retrieve the fd for the file and call write(2) etc

on it directly.

[#357](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/357)

- moved most of README to lib/Imager/Install.pod which should make it more accessible to the "web" generation, also significantly updated and re-worked it.

- updated README's for the separately distributed modules to refer to Imager::Install, and that they need -dev versions of packages [#371](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/371)

- the JPEG test code now reports the compile-time library version

- avoid a possible compiler optimization issue on CentOS 5.9 i386 by rearranging (and mildly optimizing) some code. [#374](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/374)

- fix a POD error in Imager::Fill (detected on new Pod-Simple) [#376](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/376)

- fix a broken link to Graphics::Magick [#373](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/373)

- drawing text to a channel with FT2 would draw with random coverage due to an uninitialized alpha channel.

- marked the function pointer underlying the mm_log() API with the correct gcc magic and fixed the resulting warnings.

- fixed some other compiler warnings

- Imager::Font::W32 now properly reports text drawing errors [#310](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/310)

- handle the SVf_UTF8 flag correctly on magic (eg. overloaded) strings passed as text to draw(), bounding_box(), has_chars(), glyph_names() (where supported) in each of the font drivers. This may misbehave in perl 5.6.x since the UTF8 flag may not be visible in the main SV after SvGETMAGIC(). [#377](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/377) (partial)
