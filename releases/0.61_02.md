# Imager 0.61_02

Released 28 Nov 2007

- major TIFF support re-work [#86](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/86) 
- added a C level image interface for accessing samples from 1-32 bits, exposed this at the perl level in getsamples() 
- the conv filter now works at floating point precision for high bit images 
- added is_bilevel method to test whether an image should be written as a bilevel image if the image format supports it. 
- added -log-stderr as an Imager import list option 
- added some important types to Imager::APIRef 
- added test_image_double() to Imager::Test Bug fixes: 
- Imager::Fountain couldn't read GIMP gradient files with 10 or more segments 
- the scale() method with qtype mixing now handles images with an alpha channel correctly. 
- fixed a broken link from the "animated GIF" entry in the concept index. Thanks to Slaven Rezic. [#176](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/176) 
- on some perl's the infix expression parser test would fail due to actions in the grammar returning false. Made sure all actions return a true value. Thanks to Richard Fairhurst for spending a lot of time in tracking down this problem. [#152](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/152)
