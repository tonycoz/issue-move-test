Released 05 Apr 2013

- enable debug logging for the standard font tests 
- skip the overloaded UTF-8 text output checks on 5.6.x and earlier, due to a bug in that version of perl. 
- don't test for read() failing on a write-only handle in 5.8.x and earlier, this was fixed in change 862083f7e4 in perl. 
- report the version of Inline found during testing (an attempt to diagnose some intermittent failures.)
