# Imager 0.74

Released 07 May 2010

Bug fixes:
- read_multi() didn't handle a missing file format library correctly, aborting on failing to call i_readgif_multi_wiol() or i_readtiff_multi_wiol(). 
- fix spelling errors patched by Debian http://svn.debian.org/viewsvn/pkg-perl/trunk/libimager-perl/debian/patches/spelling.patch?revision=54839&view=markup 
- add an (unshipped) author test to spellcheck Imager's POD. 
- update the TIFF file format documentation [#56510](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/56510) 
- lib/Imager/IO.pod was written almost 4 years ago but never shipped.
