# Imager 0.18

Released 28 Jun 1999

- Added global symbol table - plugins now need a symbol  table pointer in them. When the module is loaded it is  set to point at the global symbol table. Also some barebones  Makefile.PL has been made in the dynfilt directory - it works  on my system - I hope it does on yours.
