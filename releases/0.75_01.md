Released 06 Aug 2010

Test release for the new PNG probe.
- added the ability to read multiple-image PNM files. Note that unlike the pbm/pgm/ppm specification this accepts mixed format files and allows white space padding between files. Thanks to Philip Gwyn (Leolo) for this patch. 
- moved the PNG file handling code into a sub-module in preparation for separate distribution. https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/49616 (partial) Also helps avoid complications from -I/-L compile/link options from other libraries. Bugs: 
- Imager->new(data => $data) didn't try to process image file data in $data https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/58761 
- t/t50basicoo.t no longer depends on the other tests to generate its input files. https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/9798 Also, it wasn't testing pnm (pnm vs ppm mix-up) 
- update the documentation of hardinvert to match the change in 0.62. https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/59785 
- added hardinvertall filter which also inverts the alpha channel (sorry for the mess) 
- when probing for TIFF, set LD_RUN_PATH just as the Makefile does so the probe can find the library for the test run. https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/isssues/57518
