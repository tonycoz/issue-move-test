# Imager 0.75_01

[ / ](..) [releases/](./) 0.75_01

Released 06 Aug 2010

Test release for the new PNG probe.

- added the ability to read multiple-image PNM files. Note that unlike the pbm/pgm/ppm specification this accepts mixed format files and allows white space padding between files. Thanks to Philip Gwyn (Leolo) for this patch.

- moved the PNG file handling code into a sub-module in preparation for separate distribution. [#210](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/210) (partial) Also helps avoid complications from -I/-L compile/link options from other libraries.

Bugs:

- Imager->new(data => $data) didn't try to process image file data in $data [#225](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/225)

- t/t50basicoo.t no longer depends on the other tests to generate its input files. [#45](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/45) Also, it wasn't testing pnm (pnm vs ppm mix-up)

- update the documentation of hardinvert to match the change in 0.62. [#227](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/227)

- added hardinvertall filter which also inverts the alpha channel (sorry for the mess)

- when probing for TIFF, set LD_RUN_PATH just as the Makefile does so the probe can find the library for the test run. [#222](https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/222)
