# Imager 0.75_03

[ / ](..) [releases/](./)

Released 09 Aug 2010

Bug fixes:

- read_types() and write_types() would include png when it wasn't available due to a problem with the %formats tie

- handle dependent libraries correctly (eg -lpng requiring -lz) in the code run phase of library probing.
